Hello,

I wanted to share key insights from our data analysis, including data quality issues, an interesting trend, and some outstanding questions where we need your input.

Key Data Quality Issues

Users Data:
3,675 missing birth dates → Age-based insights are incomplete.
4,812 missing state values → Regional analysis is limited.
30,508 missing language values → We may not accurately personalize language preferences.
5,892 users missing gender → Demographic insights are affected.

Transactions Data:
5,762 missing barcodes → Prevents us from linking transactions to specific products.
12,500 missing FINAL_SALE values → Possible refunds, system errors, or free transactions.

Products Data:
226,472 missing brand values → We cannot accurately measure brand performance.
Placeholders like "BRAND NOT KNOWN" and "PRIVATE LABEL" suggest gaps in product tracking.
Interesting Trend
One key insight is the gender diversity within our user base. While 64,240 users identify as female and 25,829 as male, there is also a significant presence of non-binary, transgender, and self-defined gender identities. This suggests an opportunity to enhance inclusivity in our product experiences and marketing.

Assumptions Made in Analysis
To move forward with meaningful insights, we made the following assumptions:

Users:
Missing STATE values default to "Unknown" unless otherwise specified.
Missing LANGUAGE defaults to English unless inferred from region.
Missing BIRTH_DATE prevents accurate age-based segmentation.
Transactions:

Missing FINAL_SALE values are likely refunds, free products, or system issues.
Transactions without a BARCODE may still be useful if alternative product mapping exists.
Products:

"BRAND NOT KNOWN" and "PRIVATE LABEL" indicate either generic products or tracking limitations.
Missing BRAND values limit brand-level trend analysis.
Outstanding Questions & Request for Action
To refine our analysis and ensure we're making informed decisions, we need guidance on the following:

Users:
Should missing STATE values be categorized as "Unknown," or do we need to validate further?
Should missing LANGUAGE be inferred based on region, or is another source available?
Transactions:

Are transactions with missing FINAL_SALE values valid, or do they indicate system errors?
Can transactions with missing BARCODE be linked to products using alternative identifiers?
Products:

Do we have a reliable external source to fill missing brand data?
Should we exclude "BRAND NOT KNOWN" and "PRIVATE LABEL" from brand-level reports, or are they meaningful?
Would appreciate your input on these points. Let me know if we should set up a session to discuss further.

Best Wishes,
Gnanendra
